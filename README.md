# order-home-assignment

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/nghianm2803/order-home-assignment.git
   ```
#### Server
I'm encountering CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues when making API calls to Scalapay. To address these CORS problems, I've decided to set up a proxy server in NodeJS because I have some experience with it.

1. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the server on your local:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ``` 

#### Client
For the frontend web application, I use ReactJS with Material UI components, React-hook-form to manage form controls, and Yup for form validation.

1. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Run the client on your local:
   ```sh
   npm run start
   ```
